Command line tool - status option
=================================


During or after a run you can use a command to check on the progress.

Run `ocdsdata-cli status` with the source flag as the publisher you want to see. Pass the sample flag too, if it's a sample run.

By default it will show the progress for the latest run, but you can pass the dataversion flag to see different ones.
